# Sparse-Net-Clustering
Partitioning large connected graphs into clusters.
Achieves 3 objectives:
1. Generates a spine in graphs, approximating the diameter. 
2. Finds clusterheads(Landmarks) in graphs.  
3. Assigns clusters nodes to Landmarks. 

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* GNU C++11 Compiler
* Linux OS (Mac OS and Windows would work as well with a little bit of tweaking)


### Installing

Linux systems nowadays ship with a native gcc c++11 complier. However, this is not installed by default. To do this a comprehensive guide may be found here: 
* Ubuntu - [Installing GNU C and GNU C++ Compilers](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingCompilers) - similar steps for other distributions
* Windows - [Visual Studio 2017 - C++ Desktop Workload](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) - other compliers may also be used 

### Quick Link(s): 
* [Package Usage and Algorithm](https://github.com/KirtimanS/Net-Clustering/wiki) 

### Development:

Development of this binary has been done purely using C++. Since this is the engine on which the main framework for graph exploration is run, we wanted the code to be as optimized and efficient as possible and hence the use of C++ as opposed to Java or Python.
